## ModDota

Huge amount of thanks to help from community members that answered my dumb questions and those that assembled the tutorials and fleshed out the API.

## Code

This would have taken forever to do as an individual coder, so I need to make sure to give credit where it is due up front. I heavily leaned on a lot of existing open-source mods and libraries, in some cases lifting entire chunks of code from them:

- https://github.com/EarthSalamander42/dota_imba
- https://github.com/Pizzalol/SpellLibrary
- https://github.com/OpenAngelArena/oaa
